The install script in this folder will install graylog but does not use the latest configuration files.
Be sure to copy the remaining files under etc to the corresponding OS folders.

TODO: make sure to change the directories in the /etc/init.d/ files to match the install directory.

Also it will not install the OS services to automatically start/stop graylog.

To start manually, run:
	/etc/init.d/graylog start

To make the OS start explicitly when it boots, run:
	chkconfig --add mongod
	chkconfig --add elasticsearch
	chkconfig --add graylog2-server
	chkconfig --add graylog2-gui
