Log messages on gumstix post two problems:
- the network may be unavailable for long periods of time, so log message can't be sent directly to graylog;
- the SD card has limited write capacity, so constantly writing small log messages may contribute to HW failure

Possible solutions:
- when logging to files, a special logger can cache messages and only perform writes on (512-byte) block boundaries
- files can be written in a special GELF format to preserve extra fields added for graylog
- logstash can read and forward these messages over TCP when the network is active
